# 🔐 Phishing Link Detector App

An AI-powered Android app that detects phishing URLs using a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model. This application helps users stay safe from malicious websites and phishing attempts in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time phishing URL detection  
- 🧠 TensorFlow Lite model integration  
- 🗂️ Uses real phishing datasets (CSV and TXT format)  
- 📱 Built with Android Studio (Kotlin)  
- 🔒 Helps prevent malicious web access  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin  
- **Framework**: Android SDK  
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`)  
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Gradle, CSV/TXT datasets  

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The app takes a user-entered or extracted URL.  
2. It extracts relevant features from the URL.  
3. The input is passed to a **TensorFlow Lite model** for classification.  
4. The result is displayed: **Safe** or **Phishing**.

## 📦 Dataset Sources

- `phishing_site_urls.csv`  
- `phishing-links-ACTIVE.txt`  
- `phishing-IPs-ACTIVE.txt`  

These files contain known phishing URLs/IPs used to validate or train the model.
